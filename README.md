It represents the backend side of the application. It launches by default on http://localhost:8080/ .
The api documenation can be accesed at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/

frontend:  
It represents the view of the application which launches by default on http://localhost:5173/ . It uses Vite 4.5.0 + React. In order to run it you need the following:  
Node.js 20.9.0: https://nodejs.org/en  
Visual Studio Code (or any other code editor, preferably one which can open a terminal inside it): https://code.visualstudio.com/  
Once you clone the repository, in order to run the project you need to type the following command in the terminal:  
npm install  
npm run dev  

DB:  
The database where we store our users, their bucket lists and destinations. It is written in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin4 (v15). Its structure is attached below.  
In order to use it in your project, you need to do the following (Here is a tutorial on how do it in case you do not want to read :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AKIA8pu8YY):  
install PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (leave everythig checked when you need to select the componenets) and pgAdmin4 (check it when you install PostgreSQL or download it from: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/)  
launch Stack Builder at exit, select the PostgreSQL and make sure you check the psqlODBC under 'Database Drivers'  

Launch pgAdmin4:  
on the left side, in the 'Browser' list select the default Server (or create one if there is none)  
create a Database by right clicking on the 'Database' drop-down and clicking 'Create'->'Database'  
IMPORTANT: name it: BucketListDB  
right click on the 'BucketListDB', click on 'Restore'  
click on 'Filename' file icon and select the file from the DB repository file (./DB) named 'ByteSquadDB.sql'
click on the 'Restore' button  
You might be required an user and/or password to access the DB. The username and password are both: postgres  
In case there are problems, I also attached the script for it, so you can manually create it. By default, pgAdmin4 runs its server on jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/[SERVER_NAME]
